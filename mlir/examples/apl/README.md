# Heman's WIP branch

If you're seeing APL-related files in example, it's Heman's personal work, nothing clean and intended to be read by another human (except, hopefully, future Hemans).

## The Idea

APL as an MLIR frontend. Compile APL into MLIR and see what great optimizations we can pick up on a beautiful array-based langauge.

## How

1. Understand (some of) this code.
1. Get a parser and AST. See https://dfns.dyalog.com/n_parse.htm for ideas on how to parse APL
1. Emit _some_ code.
1. Get it tested

## TBD

- Will another living soul see this. Will they care?
- What's a better place for all this?
